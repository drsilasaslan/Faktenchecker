Tips to maximize your credit:
- Focus on shorter, specific statements for the most efficient use.
- For longer texts, select the most crucial parts for fact-checking.
- Monitor your usage through your Perplexity account to understand your personal usage patterns.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the extension, try these solutions:

1. **API Key Issues**: 
   - Ensure your Perplexity API key is entered correctly
   - Use the "Test Key" button to verify your API key is valid
   - Check that your Perplexity Pro subscription is active

2. **No Response or Errors**:
   - Check if you've exceeded your monthly API credits
   - Try using the "Retry" button if the fact check fails
   - Refresh the page and attempt the fact check again
   - Look for error messages in the fact check popup

3. **Missing Information**:
   - If some sections (like truth percentage or context) are missing, try using the "Retry" button
